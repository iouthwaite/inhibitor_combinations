**Abstract** \
Kinase inhibitors are successful therapeutics in the treatment of cancers and autoimmune diseases and are useful tools in biomedical research. The high sequence and structural conservation of the catalytic kinase domain complicates the development of specific kinase inhibitors. As a consequence, most kinase inhibitors also inhibit off-target kinases which complicates the interpretation of phenotypic responses. Additionally, inhibition of off-targets may cause toxicity in patients. Therefore, highly selective kinase inhibition is a major goal in both biomedical research and clinical practice. Currently, efforts to improve selective kinase inhibition are dominated by the development of new kinase inhibitors. Here, we present an alternative solution to this problem by combining inhibitors with divergent off-target activities. We have developed a multicompound-multitarget scoring (MMS) method framework that combines inhibitors to maximize target inhibition and to minimize off-target inhibition. Additionally, this framework enables rational polypharmacology by allowing optimization of inhibitor combinations against multiple selected on-targets and off-targets. Using MMS with previously published chemogenomic kinase inhibitor datasets we determine inhibitor combinations that achieve potent activity against a target kinase and that are more selective than the most selective single inhibitor against that target. We validate the calculated effect and selectivity of a combination of inhibitors using the in cellulo NanoBRET assay. The MMS framework is generalizable to other pharmacological targets where compound specificity is a challenge and diverse compound libraries are available.
